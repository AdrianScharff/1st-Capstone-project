# 📖 Capstone Project - Mexican Food Event <a name="about-project"></a>

> This is a project in which I put in practice all the skills and knowledge gained so far regarding html, css and JavaScript. This project is about a Mexican Food Event in which people can try the best mexican dishes. In this webpage I point all the details about this event in a way that users become attracted and interested on attending it.
